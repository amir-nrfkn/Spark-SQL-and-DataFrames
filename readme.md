Welcome to my DataFrames and Spark SQL practice repository!

In this repository, you will find the practice files that I used during a course on utilizing Apache 
Spark's DataFrames and Spark SQL to perform common data operations, advanced data analysis, and data 
science techniques. The sample data used in these files is a simulation of server data, including 
information on server utilization, event timestamps, free memory, server ID, and session count.

Throughout the course, I learned how to work with DataFrames API and Spark SQL to load, filter, 
aggregate, and save data, as well as how to query and modify DataFrames using SQL. I also gained 
experience in Exploratory data analysis and basic machine learning models, and was exposed to 
advanced techniques for handling null and duplicate values, as well as advanced data analysis and 
data science techniques.

I created this repository to learn how to use Apache Spark and PySpark to gain a deeper 
understanding of DataFrames and Spark SQL and apply them to real-world data scenarios. The code 
samples here helped me learn applingy the loading, filtering, aggregating, saving, querying and 
modifying DataFrames, as well as Exploratory data analysis and basic machine learnin. Feel free 
to use the files here as a reference and to test your own implementations.

Enjoy and Good Luck!
