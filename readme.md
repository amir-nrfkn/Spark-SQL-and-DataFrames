Welcome to my DataFrames and Spark SQL practice repository!

In this repository, you will find the practice files that I used during a course on utilizing Apache 
Spark's DataFrames and Spark SQL to perform common data operations, advanced data analysis, and data 
science techniques. The sample data used in these files is a simulation of server data, including 
information on server utilization, event timestamps, free memory, server ID, and session count.

Throughout the course, I learned how to work with DataFrames API and Spark SQL to load, filter, 
aggregate, and join data. I also was introduced to advanced techniques for handling null and 
duplicate values, as well as implementing exploratory data analysis, time series analysis, and 
machine learning models.

I created this repository to provide hands-on experience for anyone looking to gain a deeper 
understanding of DataFrames and Spark SQL and apply them to real-world data scenarios. Feel free to 
use the files here as a reference and to test your own implementations.

Enjoy and Good Luck!
